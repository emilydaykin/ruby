Notes, practice and examples on the Ruby programming language ðŸŽ‰

### Notes:
* To run ruby in the command line, use "interactive ruby": `irb`
* To run a ruby file, run `ruby <filename>.rb`
* [Ruby Style Guide & Best Practices](https://github.com/rubocop/ruby-style-guide)
* [Practice Ruby](https://try.ruby-lang.org/)
* Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and their interactions to design and program applications. 
  - Allows the program to block off areas of code that perform certain tasks independently of other areas in the application.
  - Encapsulation - concept of blocking off areas of code and not making it available to the rest of the program
  - Abstraction - is simplifying a complex process of a program, an enterprise software solution for example by modeling classes appropriate for it
  - Inheritance - is used where a class inherits the behavior of another class, referred to as the superclass
  - Polymorphism - is when a class inherits the behaviors of another class, but has the ability to not inherit everything and change some of itâ€™s inherited behaviors. For example to write a method that does something differently from the inherited method
  - Classes - It is a blueprint that describes the state and behavior that the objects of the class all share. A class can be used to create many objects. Objects created at runtime from a class are called instances of that particular class.
